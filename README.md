# 📦 Dead Stock Risk Prediction for Pharma Companies

## 📌 Overview
Pharmaceutical companies often face **dead stock issues** due to product expiry, fluctuating demand, overproduction, and inefficient inventory planning.  
This project focuses on building a **Machine Learning–based risk prediction model** that helps pharma companies **identify and predict dead stock risks in advance**, enabling better inventory and supply chain decisions.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Dead stock leads to:
- Financial losses due to expired medicines  
- Increased storage costs  
- Inefficient inventory utilization  
- Supply chain imbalance  

The goal of this project is to **predict the risk level of dead stock** using historical inventory and demand data, allowing companies to take **preventive actions** instead of reactive ones.

---

## Solution Approach
We developed a **risk prediction model** that:
- Analyzes historical sales and inventory patterns  
- Identifies products with low movement or high expiry risk  
- Predicts the probability of a product becoming dead stock  

This helps decision-makers optimize:
- Inventory replenishment  
- Production planning  
- Distribution strategies  

---

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**  
  - NumPy  
  - Pandas  
  - Matplotlib / Seaborn  
  - Scikit-learn
  - XG Boost 

---

## Features Used
Some key features considered in the model:
- Historical sales volume  
- Stock quantity  
- Expiry duration  
- Demand variability  
- Inventory turnover rate  

*(Features may vary based on dataset availability.)*

---

## Model Workflow
1. Data Collection & Cleaning  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Engineering  
4. Model Training  
5. Model Evaluation  
6. Risk Prediction Output  

---

## Results
- The model successfully classifies products based on **dead stock risk levels**
- Provides actionable insights for inventory control
- Can be extended for real-time or enterprise-level deployment

---

## Future Improvements
- Integration with real-time ERP systems  
- Use of advanced models (XGBoost, Random Forest, LSTM)  
- Expiry-aware optimization algorithms  
- Dashboard for visualization and decision support  

---

## Use Case
This model can be used by:
- Pharmaceutical manufacturers  
- Distributors and wholesalers  
- Supply chain analysts  
- Inventory planners  

---

## Conclusion
By leveraging Machine Learning, this project demonstrates how **data-driven decision-making** can significantly reduce dead stock risks and improve operational efficiency in the pharmaceutical supply chain.
